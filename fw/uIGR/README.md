### Switchless Overclocking for N64
---

This is an earlier project and not under development anymore. Documentation is rather simple and can be found in source code comments. Please read through for stand-alone installation.

This code is still hear as it is used on the current PCB. Please don't write me for any support for this source as stand-alone installation. Please reach out to community forums and use the knowledge and experiences there.

Best Regards, Peter
